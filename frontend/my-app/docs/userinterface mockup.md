Perfect — while we wait for the images, let’s map out all the **clickable features** your web application will need so users can navigate and interact smoothly. Since this is a **web platform (not a mobile app)**, we’ll structure it with **core navigation** (header/footer) and **in-app features** (buttons, links, cards, etc.):

---

## 🔝 **Header Navigation (always visible)**

1. **Home** – Landing page.
2. **About** – Info about the platform.
3. **Campaigns** – List of active brand campaigns.
4. **Rewards** – Rewards dashboard (earned, pending, claimable).
5. **Sign Up** – Register new account.
6. **Sign In** – Login with account or Stacks wallet.
7. **Hamburger Menu** – Expands extra links (Profile, Settings, Help, Logout).

---

## 🖥️ **Main Features (Pages/Sections)**

### For **Users (Participants)**

* **Join Campaign** (button on each campaign card).
* **Submit Proof** (link to add hashtag post proof).
* **Track Progress** (see how many mentions/posts done).
* **Claim Reward** (when conditions are met).
* **Profile** (edit details, connect wallet).
* **Notifications** (clickable bell icon for updates).

### For **Brands (Campaign Creators/Admins)**

* **Create Campaign** (button → form).
* **Set Rules** (hashtag, mentions, reward type).
* **View Participants** (clickable list).
* **Approve/Reject Proofs** (if manual verification).
* **Fund Campaign** (send STX or tokens).

---

## 🔚 **Footer (always visible)**

* **Privacy Policy**
* **Terms of Service**
* **Contact Us**

* **Social Media Links** (Twitter, Discord, GitHub).

---

## 🎯 **Utility Buttons/Icons**

*
Got it — continuing from **Utility Buttons/Icons**:

---

## 🎯 **Utility Buttons/Icons**

* **Wallet Connect / Disconnect** (Stacks wallet integration button).
* **Search Bar** (icon + field for finding campaigns or users).
* **Filter/Sort Controls** (dropdowns on campaign/reward pages).
* **Upload Button** (for proof screenshots if needed).
* **Edit / Delete** (for user posts, or brand campaigns).
* **Back to Top** (footer floating button).
* **Language Selector** (if you want multi-language support).
* **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** (UI preference).

---

## 📌 Optional but Useful Clickables

* **Invite Friends** (referral link generation).
* **Share Campaign** (social sharing buttons).
* **FAQ Accordion Toggles** (expand/collapse).
* **Support Chat Icon** (floating help chat).
* **Announcements Banner** (clickable for updates).

---

👉 With these, you’ll have **a complete clickable ecosystem**:

* **Navigation** (header/footer)
* **Core actions** (join, claim, create campaigns)
* **User tools** (profile, wallet, notifications)
* **Admin tools** (analytics, approvals)
* **Utility & extras** (search, theme, referrals)

This keeps it feature-rich but still structured.

Do you want me to **group these features into MVP (basic), medium, and advanced stages** so you don’t build everything at once but evolve step by step?


Yes — you’ll definitely want **separate dashboards** for **Users, Brands, and Admins** because their roles and clickable features are very different. This keeps the platform organized and prevents confusion. Here’s how it breaks down:

---

## 👤 **User Dashboard (Participants)**

Main goal → Join campaigns, track progress, and claim rewards.

* **My Campaigns** (joined campaigns list)
* **Join Campaigns** (browse available ones)
* **Rewards** (earned, pending, claim button)
* **Submit Proof** (link to posts/screenshots)
* **Profile & Wallet** (edit details, connect Stacks wallet)
* **Notifications** (updates from campaigns)

---

## 🏢 **Brand Dashboard (Campaign Creators)**

Main goal → Create and manage campaigns, fund rewards, monitor performance.

* **Create Campaign** (set rules, hashtags, rewards, deadline)
* **Manage Campaigns** (active, upcoming, ended)
* **Participants List** (view and verify users)
* **Fund Campaign** (send STX or tokens)
* **Analytics** (impressions, mentions, engagement stats)
* **Profile & Settings** (brand info, wallet integration)

---

## 🛠️ **Admin Dashboard (Platform Owners/Moderators)**

Main goal → Oversee the entire system, prevent abuse, and manage disputes.

* **Overview** (campaign stats, platform activity)
* **User Management** (suspend, verify, or approve users/brands)
* **Campaign Moderation** (approve/reject campaigns, handle flagged posts)
* **Payments & Escrow** (monitor payouts, resolve disputes)
* **Reports & Analytics** (overall platform growth)
* **System Settings** (roles, permissions, fees)

---

👉 So the **header/footer links** act as general entry points, but once logged in, users get directed to their **role-specific dashboard**.

Would you like me to **design the wireframe layouts** (visual mockup structure) of these three dashboards one by one so you can see how each looks?


I see what happened — thanks for pointing it out. I’m not hallucinating, but the AI image generator I used doesn’t always follow very specific structured layout instructions (like exact header text + navigation order) as precisely as code would. That’s why the last header design came out different from what you clearly described.

Let’s reset clearly:

✅ Header must have this exact order:

* **Micro Influencers** (title/logo — can be tiny if space is tight)
* **Home**
* **About**
* **Campaigns**
* **Rewards**
* **Sign Up**
* **Sign In**
* **Hamburger menu (≡) if space constraint**

✅ Footer can stay simple (social icons, copyright, or navigation repeat).

Would you like me to generate **a corrected graphic with exactly that structure** (as close as possible), or do you prefer I **write the actual React/Vite header+footer code with module.css** so you get a pixel-perfect result in your project?

Since you already have the **header** locked in with title and navigation, the next logical visual would be the **hero section** — the first big section right under the header.

For your **micro influencers platform**, that hero could show:

* **Headline**: A bold, catchy phrase like *“Empowering Micro Influencers, One Campaign at a Time.”*
* **Subtext**: A short description about what users gain (e.g., *“Join campaigns, earn rewards, and grow your influence.”*).
* **CTA buttons**: “Start a Campaign” (for brands) and “Join as Influencer” (for creators).
* **Visual element**: A modern illustration or mockup of influencers on social media (phones, likes, shares, etc.).

Would you like me to generate that **hero section mockup** next, so it fits right under the header we already designed?

We’ve already done the **header + footer** and now the **homepage hero section**.

The natural next visual image would be the **“Features/Services Section”** that sits right below the hero. This is usually where you highlight:

* 3–4 key features, services, or benefits of the platform.
* Each feature in a card or column layout (with an icon, short title, and 1–2 lines of text).
* A consistent style that matches the hero section.

After that, the flow usually goes:

1. **Header** ✅
2. **Hero Section** ✅
3. **Features/Services Section** ⬅️ Next
4. **Testimonials / Social Proof**
5. **Call-to-Action (CTA) Section**
6. **Footer** ✅

Would you like me to generate the **Features/Services section** visual next?

Great! The next visual should be for the **“Features Section”** of your homepage.

This part will visually highlight **3–4 key features/benefits** of your platform in a clean, balanced layout. Each feature should have:

* An icon or small illustration
* A short heading
* A one-line description

Do you want me to go ahead and generate the **features section visual**?

Great — after **testimonial/user reviews**, the next logical section to design is the **Call to Action (CTA) section**.

This is usually a bold, visually engaging part that motivates users to take the next step — for example:

* **"Get Started" button**
* **"Join Now" prompt**
* **"Download App" or "Sign Up Free" message**

It should stand out with clear typography and a visually striking background (solid color, gradient, or illustration).

👉 Do you want me to generate the **CTA section visual** next?

👉 The next logical visual would be the Footer Section.
It usually includes:

Company logo or brand name

Navigation links (Home, About, Features, Contact, etc.)

Social media icons

Contact info or newsletter signup

Copyright notice

Do you want me to generate the Footer Section visual next?

Great — now that we’ve covered the homepage sections (hero, about, features, testimonials, CTA, footer), the **next visual image** you should create is for **internal pages**. Common next visuals include:

1. **Sign Up / Login Page** – clean form design with illustrations.
2. **Dashboard / User Profile** – what users see after logging in.
3. **Contact Page** – form + map illustration or support graphic.
4. **Pricing Page** – tiered plans with icons.

👉 I suggest we start with the **Sign Up / Login page visual** next. Do you want me to generate that?

We also need a separate Organization Dashboard (for brands/organizations running campaigns). This would include features like:

Campaign Management – create, edit, pause, or delete campaigns.

Analytics & Insights – impressions, clicks, conversions, engagement rates.

Budget & Spend Tracking – show how much has been spent vs. remaining.

User Engagement Overview – demographics, top-performing users, locations.

Payout & Billing – track payments to participants, invoices, and budgets.

Notifications & Alerts – campaign milestones, low budget warnings, etc.

👉 So yes, the next visual we should generate is the Organization (Brand) Dashboard UI.

The next logical visual to create is the Campaign Details Page (where a user clicks on a campaign and sees full information about it).

This page would include:

Campaign title & banner image

Brand/organization info

Campaign description & requirements

Rewards breakdown

Call-to-action button (“Join Campaign” or “Apply”)

Progress stats (e.g., spots filled, time left)

Do you want me to generate this Campaign Details Page

The next logical visual to design would be a User Profile Page.

This page will display personal details and activity history for a platform user (whether they are an influencer, affiliate, or campaign participant). It should include:

Profile picture

Name & bio

Contact/social links

Earnings summary (if applicable)

Campaign participation history

Badges or achievement highlights

Do you want me to generate this User Profile Page visual now?

The next visual image should be a Payment & Wallet Page.
This will showcase how users (influencers, publishers, or campaign participants) can see their earnings, withdraw funds, and track payment history.

Do you want me to generate this payment & wallet visual now?

The natural next visual would be the Rewards & Payments page.
This page will show users their earned rewards, pending payouts, transaction history, and options for withdrawing or redeeming.

Do you want us to generate the Rewards & Payments page next?

The next important visual should be the Admin Dashboard.
This is for the platform owner (the middleman connecting brands and earners). It should include:

Overview of total users (earners + organizations)

Total campaigns running

Total payouts made

Reports on fraudulent activities / suspicious accounts

Control panel to suspend/approve campaigns

Platform revenue & commission tracking

Would you like me to generate this Admin Dashboard visual now?
